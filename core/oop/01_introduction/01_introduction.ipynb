    "\n",
    "* abstraction using Classes: We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. The class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide which data member will be visible to the outside world and which is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstraction in Header files: One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate the power of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually calculating the power of numbers."

    "## Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An operation may exhibit different behaviours in different instances. The behaviour depends upon the types of data used in the operation.\n",

    "    * Operator Overloading: The process of making an operator to exhibit different behaviours in different instances is known as operator overloading.\n",

    " The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.\n",

    "* Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.\n",

    "##  Dynamic Binding:\n",
    " In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is decided at runtime. C++ has virtual functions to support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Message Passing:\n",
    " Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other. A message for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the function and the information to be sent."
