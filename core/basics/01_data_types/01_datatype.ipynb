The reason for this is the valid range of character datatype is -128 to 127. When ‘a’ become 128 through a++, the range is exceeded and as a result the first number from negative side of the range (i.e. -128) gets assigned to a. As a result of this ‘a’ will never reach at point 225. so it will print the infinite series of character."
